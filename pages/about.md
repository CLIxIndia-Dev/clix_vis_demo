 We are part of CLIx project, CIER, TISS, Mumbai. This website is created to give access to different platform datasets generated as part of implementation of CLIx project (basically, digital exhaust of students). Different teams across CLIx project can explore these datasets through visualizations provided on top 
of raw datasets. Questions explored in these visualisations are due to interaction of tech team with other teams in terms of platform data requirements. 

  We have also collated different datasets and resources used for generating these visualisations.
