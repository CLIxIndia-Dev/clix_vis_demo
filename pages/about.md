This alpha website provides access to Visializations of various datasets being generated from CLIxPlatform - a student learning platform - as part of Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx) project. 

Different teams across CLIx project can explore these datasets through visualizations built on top of raw datasets. 

Questions explored in these visualisations are outcome of collaborative exploration between CLIx technology team and leasdership, domain and research teams.

This is just an alpha site (very initial glimpses) towards an aspirational meta-visualization dashboard.
