This demo website provides access to Visualizations of various datasets being generated from CLIxPlatform - a student learning platform - as part of Connected Learning Initiative (CLIx) project. 

The objective is that different teams across CLIx project can explore these datasets through visualizations built on top of raw data.

The data is mainly coming from the CLIx server at the school ICT lab through syncthing.

Questions explored in these visualisations are outcome of collaborative exploration between CLIx technology team and leasdership, domain and research teams.

This is just an alpha site (very initial glimpses) towards an aspirational meta-visualization dashboard.
