 We are tech team of CLIx project, CIER, TISS, Mumbai. This website is created to give access to different platform datasets generated as part of implementation of CLIx project (basically, digital exhaust of students). Different teams across CLIx project can explore these datasets through visualizations provided on top 
of raw datasets. 

  We have also collated different datasets and resources used for generating these visualisations.
