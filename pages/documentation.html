          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
             <p>This page contains doumentation of methodology and data processing involved in generating visualisations for this website.
		We have a section for each type(based on data source) of visualisation, with all the information about data source, processing and 
		different metrics used. The questions underlying these visualisations are coming from our interaction with different teams of CLIx 
		community, research team in particular.</p>

		       <h4>Data Source:</h4>
		       <p>Primary Source of tools data is json file generated whenever a user accesses Tools/Apps section of the 
			  CLIx software. These files along with other thin data are available from schools as part of synthing data.
			  In a given school (in a particular machine), seperate json file is generated for each tool. 
			  This json file will have logs of all the users of the tool on that machine.
                       </p>
                       <h4>Important Note:</h4>
		       <p> One specific aspect of project implementation is that not all students who are using the platform are registered. These non-registered 
		       users  correspond to anonymous users and are logged with common user_id(=0). So logs corresponding to anonymous user is 
		       usually due to more than one student. In all these cases, we have left out anonymous user observations (as it is difficult to 
		       infer student level activity). They actually correspond to substantial part of the total observations. We have a simple 
		       methodology as of now to approximate number of users in anonymous user_id, but have deffered its implementation until we discuss this with 
		       research and other teams.

			<h4>Data Processing:</h4>
	 	       <p>To process tools data, we first convert json files into csv files extracting only information relevant for our analysis.
		       All these csv files of tools across all the schools is collated to create one big csv file. Each row of 
		       this <a href="{{site.github.url}}/pages/data_source.html">csv file</a> corresponds to a unique log of a user with the 
		       following features (columns): </br></br>

		      <i>school_server_code</i>: Unique code of the school in which log is generated</br>
		      <i>user_id</i>: Unique id of a student creating the log</br>
		      <i>tool_name</i>: Tool name of the tool being accessed</br>
		      <i>created_at</i>: Timestamp of creation of the log </br>
		      <i>date_created</i>: Date of creation of log </br>
		      <i>time_spent</i>: Time spent by a student(=user_id) on the tool(=tool_name) on a given day(=date_created). This is 
		      calculated by taking time difference between first and last log time_stamps of a every user_id in a given day.</br>
		      <i>state_code</i>: State in which machine is located</br></br>

                        <p>
			<h5>Total Number of Days Tool is Used </h5> 
			  <h6> How many days was the tools section of the platform used during the observation period? </h6>
		          <p>This corresponds to total number of days tools section was accessed (irrespective of the time spent) by students. 
		           In a given school, for each tool, we add up all unique date entries (a date entry corresponds to atleast one student accessing tool). 
			   This sum gives us the total number of unique days a tool was accessed by students during the observation period.</p>
                       <h5>Average Number of Students Engaged in a Day</h5>
		          <h6> How many students are engaging with a particular tool in a given school on an average? </h6> 
		          <p>This gives us the number of students accessing a particular tool in a day on an average. In a given school, for each 
		          tool and for each date, we add up number of unique user_id's to get number of students. Then this number is averaged across 
			  observation period. Please note that for each tool averaging is done considering only dates on which it was used, so time period 
			  across which we are averaging could be different for different tools.</p>
                       <h5>Total Number of Students Engaged in a School </h5>
		          <h6> How many students in total were engaged with a particular tool in a given school? </h6> 
		          <p>This is the aggregate number of unique students engaged with each tool of the platform. In a given school, for each 
		          tool, we add up number of unique user_id's (during the whole period of observation) to get number of students. 
			  Summed up number on y-axis can be interpreted as total number of unique students engaged with the tools for the corresponding school.</p>

		<!--	  
                       <h5>Average Time Spent by a Student in a Day</h5>
		         <h6> How long did students of a particular school use a tool in a day on an average? </h6> 
		         <p>In a given school, for each tool and for each unique user, total time spent on a day is calculated. This number is averaged 
			 across all days for which observations are available. This gives us the average time spent (averaged across students and days) 
			 for each tool. Again here also please note that for each tool averaging is done considering only dates on which it was used (which 
			 could be different for different tools), so time period across which we are averaging could be different for different tools. </p>
                       <h5>Average Attendance for Tools</h5>
		         <h6> How many students used a tool out of total students in a particular day on an average? </h6>
		         <p>In a given school, for each day, attendance (as a subset of total students present on that day) for each tool is 
			 calculated. This number is averaged across all dates for which observations are avilable. This gives us the average number of students using a 
			 tool out of all the students present on a particular day. Here averaging is done considering same dates for 
			 all tools in a given school.</p>

		       <h4>Data Source:</h4>
		       <p>Module level progress csvs are generated every hour in each school and is packaged in to syncthing tar file which 
		       is referred as thin data. Each csv, lists the students along with their buddies if any and quantitative data in a 
		       cummulative way. This quantitative data talks about the total lessons, activites visited along with the percentage of 
		       completion and even the number of times a particular activity being visited.</br></br>
		       
		       For eg: if there is a file generated on a particular day at 12h09min which contains few students data, 
		       the next file of 13h09min has the cummulative data(data of 12h09min file plus the data generated in between 12th hr to 
		       13th hr). Hence cummulative.                       
		       </p>
                       </div>

		       <h4> Important Note:</h4>
		       <p>
		       As students can explore the courses even without logging into the platform, each of such entry corresponds to anonymous 
		       user ‘0’. But while fetching data related to a particular module the extraction of anonymous user’s data is not considered 
		       unlike to tools data as they are generated from 3rd party not by the platform itself.
		       </p>
		      <div class="section" id="data_processing2"> 
			<h4>Data Processing:</h4>
			<p>
			Following steps are followed as part of collating the progress data across all schools of a particular state for a given 
			month of enagagement:
			</p>
			<h5> Data Fetching </h5> <p>Since the data generated is in a cummulative way, we need to find the latest file created on the 
			last day of that month. This includes all the data since the enagagement started in that school till that month.</p>
			<h5> Data Cleaning </h5> <p>As part cleaning, have removed all the rows pertaining to internal accounts and the resultant csv 
			holds data only pertaining to the student Ids ending with the schools code eg: red-bull-rj1 etc.</p>
			<h5> Data Collation </h5> <p>All the latest course progress csvs from every school are then collated into a single csv along 
			with inclusion of few new columns which are as follows:</p>
                        <p> 
			<i>Date</i>:The last date of the given month on which enagegment took place in a particular school.</br>
			<i>Day, Month, Year</i>: These columns are populated by splitting the above Date column value accordingly.</br>
			<i>UnitCode</i>:Each unit is given a unique code given by Research Team and the same is populated respectively.</br></br>
                        </p>
			<h5>Data Aggregation </h5> <p>Aggregation is done on the final collated csv by grouping on server_id and module_name columns 
			to calculate the following:</p>
                         
			- Number of students who visited a particular module</br>
			- Average percentage if activities visited in a module</br></br>

			  <h6> How many students have gone through a particular module in a given school? </h6>
		          <p>This gives us the total number of students who have gone through a particular module. In a given school, 
			  for each module, we add up number of unique user_id's to get total number of students.</p>
                        <h5>Average Percentage of Activities Visited in a Module</h5>
		          <h6> What is the percentage of activities visited by a student in a given module? </h6> 
		          <p>This gives us the average percentage of activities visited by any of students who have gone through a 
			  particular module. In a given school, for each module, we calculate the sum of percentage_activities_visited and 
			  then average it across number of students.</p>
