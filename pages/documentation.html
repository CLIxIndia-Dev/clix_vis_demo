          <h2>Getting Started</h2>
             <p>This page contains doumentation of methodology and data processing involved in generating visualisations for this website.
		We have a section for each type(based on data source) of visualisation, with all the information about data source, processing and 
		different metrics used. The questions underlying these visualisations are coming from our interaction with different teams of CLIx 
		community, research team in particular.</p>

		       <h4>Data Source:</h4>
		       <p>Primary Source of tools data is json file generated whenever a user accesses Tools/Apps section of the 
			  CLIx software. These files along with other thin data are available from schools as part of synthing data.
			  In a given school (in a particular machine), seperate json file is generated for each tool. 
			  This json file will have logs of all the users of the tool on that machine.

			<h4>Data Processing:</h4>
	 	       <p>To process tools data, we first convert json files into csv files extracting only information relevant for our analysis.
		       All these csv files of tools across all the schools is collated to create one big csv file. Each row of 
		       this <a href="{{site.github.url}}/pages/data_source.html">csv file</a> corresponds to a unique log of a user with the 
		       following features (columns): </br></br>

		      <i>school_server_code</i>: Unique code of the school in which log is generated</br>
		      <i>user_id</i>: Unique id of a student creating the log</br>
		      <i>tool_name</i>: Tool name of the tool being accessed</br>
		      <i>created_at</i>: Timestamp of creation of the log </br>
		      <i>date_created</i>: Date of creation of log </br>
		      <i>time_spent</i>: Time spent by a student(=user_id) on the tool(=tool_name) on a given day(=date_created). This is 
		      calculated by taking time difference between first and last log time_stamps of a every user_id in a given day.</br>
		      <i>state_code</i>: State in which machine is located</br></br>

                        <p>
			<h5>Total Days Accessed</h5> 
			  <h6> How many days was the platform accessed during the observation period? </h6>
		          <p>This corresponds to total number of days tools section was accessed (irrespective of the time spent) by students. 
		           In a given school, for each tool, we add up all unique date entries (a date entry corresponds to atleast one student accessing tool). 
			   This sum gives us the total number of unique days a tool was accessed by students during the observation period.</p>
                       <h5>Average Number of Students in a Day</h5>
		          <h6> How many students are accessing a particular tool in a given school on an average? </h6> 
		          <p>This gives us the number of students accessing a particular tool in a day on an average. In a given school, for each 
		          tool and for each date, we add up number of unique user_id's to get number of students. Then this number is averaged across 
			  observation period. Please note that for each tool averaging is done considering only dates on which it was used, so time period 
			  across which we are averaging could be different for different tools.</p>
                       <h5>Average Time Spent by a Student in a Day</h5>
		         <h6> How long did students of a particular school use a tool in a day on an average? </h6> 
		         <p>In a given school, for each tool and for each unique user, total time spent on a day is calculated. This number is averaged 
			 across all days for which observations are available. This gives us the average time spent (averaged across students and days) 
			 for each tool. Again here also please note that for each tool averaging is done considering only dates on which it was used (which 
			 could be different for different tools), so time period across which we are averaging could be different for different tools. </p>
                       <h5>Average Attendance for Tools</h5>
		         <h6> How many students used a tool out of total students in a particular day on an average? </h6>
		         <p>In a given school, for each day, attendance (as a subset of total students present on that day) for each tool is 
			 calculated. This number is averaged across all dates for which observations are avilable. This gives us the average number of students using a 
			 tool out of all the students present on a particular day. Here averaging is done considering same dates for 
			 all tools in a given school.</p>
